# React.js demo

This is the code base for the **[React demo page](https://dnzk.github.io/react-demo)**.

## Disclaimer

The status of the demo page is **always in development**. Its purpose is to show what the code in this repository produces, so it will be updated as frequent as possible. The goal of this whole project is to show my understanding of React.js, and I will try to show it in iterative manner -- when I find spots to improve upon, I will improve them.

This app consumes [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co), so there is no "two ways" communication between the app and SWAPI at the moment to be shown because SWAPI is all about GET request.

This project serves as a sort of portfolio (it is a part of a series of projects with similar nature, only with different frameworks) and as a device of my personal development.
